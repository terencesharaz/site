== What’s in it ==

**Optimization of homepage + 5 pages , embedded images included**
10Web Booster is made possible thanks to dozens of technical optimizations:


= CSS & HTML Minification & Compression =

The minification and merger of CSS and HTML is the procedure of reducing file size by a couple of bytes. The significance of this stems from the fact that larger files require more resources which may slow down website load time.

= JS Minification and Compression =

Compression of lengthy algorithmic JS codes is standard practice. The crunching of JS code, meaning, the removal of all the extra spaces and comments reduces the time of downloading  JavaScript, directly improving WordPress Speed.

= Image Optimization =

Image optimization leans on minimizing file size through image compression while simultaneously preserving image quality. 10Web’s image optimizations achieve that and more.

= Defer JS and CSS Execution =

Having content that's immediately visible when a user opens your website is only possible with file load optimization through prioritization of important CSS and deferral of JavaScript.  That’s how 10Web booster ensures a 90+ page speed score as the best WordPress speed plugin.

= Critical CSS =

Downloading complete CSS files hinder the perceived speed of your WordPress website. After the user visits the webpages, initially, the minimum-necessary stylesheets for the proper rendering of the webpage’s visible content are loaded, while the rest is served per need. Critical CSS doesn’t block page rendering and assists in passing the Core Web Vitals.

= Image Lazy load =

Giving in to the attention span of your website user is how you improve WordPress speed. Lazy loading images and executing only crucial information in the first seconds is how you achieve that. images that keep your website’s latency low and your speed high decrease bounce rate and work to your advantage.

= Font Swap =

The reduction and optimization of how web fonts load could potentially help in passing the Core Web Vitals assessment, thus, benefit your ranking on Google.
Since the competition is off the charts, every millisecond counts, for the following purpose your content will be displayed in a generic font, thus, bridging the time until your original font style is set up


= Conversion of Image Format to WebP =

WebP compression studies prove that a WebP image file on average is:
25-34% smaller than a comparable JPEG image
26% smaller than a comparable PNG image
So it’s only logical that this conversion would substantially affect and improve WordPress speed


= iFrame and Video Lazy load =

From images to video ads there is a range of content on your website that isn’t visible unless the user scrolls down. 
The user shouldn’t be forced to download hefty data when they don’t scroll.
10Web Booster signifies this concept as users should never have to pay the price of a slower website for no good reason. 


= Container-specific Image Resizing =

With 10Web Booster, instead of forcing your website to load an enormous image when the user’s only looking for a thumbnail, you’ll have a container-specific image at your disposal.


**10Web Booster Pro** 

= Full frontend optimization of the entire website and all images =
= Backend optimization =



**Speed Optimization Modes**

When your automated homepage optimization kicks off, we test out each and every one of the 4 modes. Consequently, we compare the results, and, as presumed, the mode that achieved the highest score while simultaneously keeping your website from breaking, will be set as your default.

You can choose any of the following four modes and manage the modes for each page individually from the Custom rules tab in your dashboard.

*   **Standard Mode:** -  Uses different standard speed optimization techniques.
*   **Balanced Mode:** -  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + Critical CSS
*   **Strong Mode:** -  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + JS Delay.
*   **Extreme Mode:** -  All optimization techniques in Balanced Mode + JS Delay. It may cause issues in some cases.

WP Super Cache
WP Rocket
WP Rocket Footer JS
Autoptimize
Perfmatters
WP Fastest Cache
WP-Optimize
Asset CleanUp
Shortpixel AI
Rocket Lazy load
Hummingbird
Smush
Flying Scripts
Async JavaScript
NitroPack
PageSpeed Ninja
Swift Performance Lite
Swift Performance
Fast Velocity Minify
LiteSpeed Cache

Ezoic

= 11. What’s the difference between cache plugins and 10Web Booster?  =
To sum up caching plugins, they attempt to speed up your website by simply caching files, clearing site cache, compressing cached pages, and performing HTML minification. They don’t require third-party servers for operation and run inside WP servers.

10Web Booster is more than just a plugin, it’s a service that speeds up your website with a wider range of optimization techniques. These techniques can only be implemented using a specific service for website optimization (10Web Booster services), rather than running the solution inside of the WordPress hosting server.
